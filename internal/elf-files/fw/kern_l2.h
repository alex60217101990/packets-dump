    'mac_blacklist' here represents the various MAC addresses we wish to drop, and is of type 'BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH'.
    This is the first time we have interacted with a HASH variant of a BPF map. And it comes with some additional
    things to keep in mind.
    First off notice that we have a new field 'map_flags' we are specifying bellow as opposed to when we were defining the,
    'BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY' and 'BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY' maps in the previous sections. The field in question controls
    how the kernel initializes the map itself. In this case we pass in the flag 'BPF_F_NO_PREALLOC' which means the kernel
    will not prepopulate the map with entires for each of the entires up to 'max_entries'. This important because if we did
    not specify this flag the entire map would be filled with data as soon as we loaded the program.
    Another thing of note here, is that we are _not_ using a PERCPU vairant of the 'BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH' map, because we don't
    actually update the entries contained within the map from the kernel. We are just looking for the existence of a given
    MAC address in this map so there is no need to worry about locking in this case. This also significantly reduces the memory
    requirements of manging this map.
    Lastly we are specifying a 'value_size' of 1 here because, as previously mentioned, we are going to specifically using this
    map to test for existance, and therefore as a boolean value to trigger dropping or accepting a packet for further processing.
