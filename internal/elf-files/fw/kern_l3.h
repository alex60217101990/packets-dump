    'v4_blacklist' here represenst the various IPv4 ranges we want to drop, and is of type 'BPF_MAP_TYPE_LPM_TRIE' which
    is a specialized BPF map type for longest prefix matching on keys. This map type is interacted with the same way as
    any other BPF map but the key matching is different in that it is capable of "ranging" matching against passed in values.
    The actual algorithm isn't important for the purposes of this workshop. However it allows for matching a packets ip address,
    say '192.168.0.1' against a range containing that IP address say '192.168.0.0/24' while not matching against the range
    '192.168.1.0/24'. This is incredibly useful in the context of XDP and DDoS mitigation because generally you don't want to
    only drop a specific address but a range of addresses.
    Other than the algorithm its important to note that the key structure here needs to be of a specific ordering specifically:
        struct bpf_lpm_trie_key {
            __u32	prefixlen;	// up to 32 for AF_INET, 128 for AF_INET6
            __u8	data[0];	// Arbitrary size
        };
    We aren't using the above structure which is defined in the kernel sources, because XDP requires fixed sized structures, i.e.
    we can't allocate memory on our own. So the key values bellow are defined in common.h with a fixed size so we can easily use
    them in this program.
